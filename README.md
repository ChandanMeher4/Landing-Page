## 📖 Project Overview
**GitStory** is a conceptual SaaS landing page built for the **AutoBotWa Internship Recruitment Task**.

Instead of a generic agency website, I designed a **Developer-First Tool**. GitStory is an AI agent that connects to GitHub, analyzes commit history/diffs, and automatically generates human-readable blog posts, changelogs, and stand-up updates.

The design follows a **"Cyberpunk/Dark Mode" aesthetic** (Slate-950 background with Neon Green/Purple accents) to resonate specifically with the target audience of software engineers.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Cyberpunk Grid & Glassmorphism effects)
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **AI generation:** Vercel v0 (Generative UI)
* **Language:** JavaScript (React)

---

## 🤖 Vercel v0 Implementation Notes
*Required by assignment.*

I utilized **Vercel v0** extensively to accelerate the UI development process. Here is the breakdown of my workflow:

1.  **Thematic Prompting:** I prompted v0 to generate a specific "Dark Mode SaaS" aesthetic, strictly using `lucide-react` icons and a monospace typography system to mimic a code editor environment.
2.  **Layout Scaffolding:** v0 generated the responsive grids for the **Features**, **Testimonials**, and **Pricing** sections. I specifically requested side-by-side layouts for tablet/desktop (md/lg breakpoints) while maintaining a stacked layout for mobile.
3.  **Visual "Magic" Section:** I used v0 to create the complex "Visual Demo" section—a split view showing raw code on the left transforming into a clean blog post on the right.
4.  **Refinement:** I used iterative prompts to fix spacing issues and ensure the "Trusted By" and "FAQ" sections were visually distinct from the rest of the content.

---

## ✨ Key Features
* **Responsive Hero Section:** High-conversion layout with glowing background effects.
* **Interactive Visual Demo:** A "Code-to-Content" visualization using glassmorphism.
* **Grid Layouts:** robust CSS Grid implementation for Features and Pricing cards.
* **FAQ Accordion:** A fully functional, state-driven React accordion component.
* **Internal UI System:** Custom `Button` and `Card` components built directly into the page for modularity without external library dependencies.
